In task 1 we have used 4 Python notebook files (.ipynb)

1. SA_Task1_Preprocessing1_1037144.ipynb
	In this notebook we performing the intial pre processing and the feature engineering, generating 3 different sets Training Data
2. SA_Task1_Preprocessing2_1037144.ipynb
	In this notebook we are performing pre procesing and feature extraction on the Validation Data(with labels) and the test data. Also generating 3 different sets for both
3. SA_CBLOF_1037144.ipynb
	In this notebook we have trained and fitted the CBLOF model, tuned it on the Validation data and colated resutls/predictions for the Test data.
	This notebook generate 3 sets of output files (.csv).
	- Set1_CBLOF_1037144.csv
	- Set2_CBLOF_1037144.csv
	- Set3_CBLOF_1037144.csv
4. SA_IFOREST_1037144.ipynb
	In this notebook we have trained and fitted the IFOREST model, tuned it on the Validation data and colated resutls/predictions for the Test data.
	This notebook generate 3 sets of output files (.csv).
	- Set1_iForest_1037144.csv
	- Set2_iForest_1037144.csv
	- Set3_iForest_1037144.csv
